## Introduction

`renv` is an R package that helps manage project-specific R dependencies. It ensures that your project's environment remains consistent and reproducible across different machines and environments. This guide outlines the steps to install and set up `renv` in a new R project and install dependencies within the `renv` environment.

Although packages required for the right use of the eurostatRToolCustom package can be installed following the standard way for package installation in Rstudio, we strongly recommend to use the `renv` environment instead.

## Installing and setting up renv

1. **Install renv**: Start by installing the `renv` package from CRAN. Open your R console or RStudio and run the following command:

    ```R
    install.packages("renv")
    ```

2. **Create a new R project**: Start by creating a new R project in your desired directory. You can do this in RStudio by navigating to File > New Project > New Directory > R Project.

3. **Initialize renv in your project**: Navigate to your project directory within RStudio or set it as the working directory using the following command:

    ```R
    setwd("path_to_your_project_directory")
    ```

    Then, initialize `renv` within your project directory:

    ```R
    renv::init()
    ```

    This command sets up `renv` in your project directory and creates the necessary files.

## Installing Dependencies in renv Environment

Once `renv` is set up in your project, you can install and manage dependencies within the `renv` environment. Below are the dependencies along with their versions specified after the `==` sign:

- configr (== 0.3.5)
- dplyr (== 1.1.4)
- DT (== 0.32)
- flexdashboard (== 0.6.2)
- htmltools (== 0.5.8)
- leaflet (== 2.2.1)
- lubridate (== 1.9.3)
- magick (== 2.8.3)
- magrittr (== 2.0.3)
- mapview (== 2.11.2)
- metathis (== 1.1.4)
- plotly (== 4.10.3)
- rmarkdown (== 2.25)
- shiny (== 1.8.0)
- shinydashboard (== 0.7.2)
- sp (== 2.1.3)
- tidyr (== 1.3.0)
- utils (== 4.3.2)
- xlsx (== 0.6.5)

To install these dependencies in the `renv` environment, follow these steps:

1. **Open R console or RStudio**: Make sure you are working within your project directory.

2. **Install dependencies**: Use the `renv::install()` function to install all the dependencies:

    ```R
    renv::install(c(
        "configr@0.3.5",
        "dplyr@1.1.4",
        "DT@0.32",
        "flexdashboard@0.6.2",
        "htmltools@0.5.8",
        "leaflet@2.2.1",
        "lubridate@1.9.3",
        "magick@2.8.3",
        "magrittr@2.0.3",
        "mapview@2.11.2",
        "metathis@1.1.4",
        "plotly@4.10.3",
        "rmarkdown@2.25",
        "shiny@1.8.0",
        "shinydashboard@0.7.2",
        "sp@2.1-3",
        "tidyr@1.3.0",
        "tools@4.3.2",
        "utils@4.3.2",
        "xlsx@0.6.5"
    ))
    ```

3. **Snapshot the environment**: After installing all dependencies, take a snapshot of the environment by running:

    ```R
    renv::snapshot()
    ```

    This creates or updates the `renv.lock` file, which contains information about the project's environment.

## Load the eurostatRToolCustom package in the project

Now that your project environment is ready, you can load the eurostatRToolCustom package by `library(eurostatRToolCustom)`
and start to use it.

## Conclusion

By setting up `renv` in your R project and managing dependencies within the `renv` environment, you ensure reproducibility and consistency in your R project's environment. This helps maintain the integrity of your project across different systems and facilitates collaboration among team members.
