# eurostatRTool

The eurostatRTool is an R package developed by Eurostat, offering a robust and flexible environment 
for the visualisation and analysis of economic indicators. With eurostatRTool, 
users can create customisable HTML dashboards that display a wide range of indicators 
through various visualisation types, including time series plots, bar charts, and maps. 
The package enables users to effortlessly customise the overall layout, update underlying data, 
and select specific visualisation modes and interpretative texts to feature in the dashboard. 
This flexibility makes it easy to tailor the tool to specific needs, ensuring that the visualised data is both meaningful and accessible.

A standout feature of eurostatRTool is the storyboard layout from `Flexdashboard` that organises information into a sequence of slides. 
This layout allows users to present a step-by-step narrative, providing readers with a more comprehensive understanding of the data. 
The user-friendly navigation enables viewers to move back and forth through the data story at their own pace, fostering a more interactive and engaging exploration.

## Installation

Please note that the package has been only tested in R version 4.3 thus
if you are using later versions of R we cannot ensure its right
functioning.

### For Windows users: install Rtools

For installing R packages from source on Windows, users also need to
install `Rtools`, which provides the necessary tools for building R
packages.

1.  Download: go to the [Rtools download
    page](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) and download
    the appropriate version of Rtools.

2.  Install: run the downloaded installer and follow the installation
    instructions. Make sure to select the option to modify the system
    PATH during installation.

### Install devtools package in R

Open R or RStudio and install the `devtools` package from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```

### Install R package from source

Now, you can use `devtools::install_github()` or `devtools::install()`
to install R packages directly from GitHub or other sources.
Specifically, the eurostatRTool package can be installed from GitHub by
running:

``` r
devtools::install_github("eurostat/eurostatRTool")
```

This should directly install the package from Github, without any other
steps. 

The following packages are required: `configr`,  `dplyr`,  `DT`, `flexdashboard`, `htmltools`, `leaflet`, `lubridate`, `magick`,
`magrittr`, `mapview`,  `metathis`, `plotly`, `rmarkdown`, `shiny`, `shinydashboard`, `sp`, `tidyr` and `xlsx`.

Setting up an renv environment for this project is recommended but not
mandatory. The setup of a [renv environment](https://rstudio.github.io/renv) provide a robust and reliable way to
manage dependencies, ensuring that the R project you will setup to use
this R package is isolated. By creating a specific renv environment for
this R package, you will be able to set its dependencies in the same
version used during the building and testing of the R package, to avoid
errors due to package updating. The environment will be isolate from
your other projects, allowing you to change the version of the
dependencies in other projects without affecting the project you setup
for using this R package and viceversa.

## Getting started

The eurostatRTool package requires some learning to be
used properly. Below we provide a basic example which shows you how to generate a
general dashboard in a given output folder:

``` r
library(eurostatRTool)
eurostatRTool::generate_dashboard("path/to/output/folder")
```

## Further help and documentation

For general help with the eurostatRTool, you should look into the [Wiki page for this project](https://github.com/eurostat/eurostatRTool/wiki) 
or the packageâ€™s documentation, which is available by checking the individual
function documentation (`?function_name`) and also via the vignettes, using `utils::browseVignettes("eurostatRTool")`.
