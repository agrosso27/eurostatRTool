# eurostatRTool

The eurostatRTool is an R package developed by Eurostat, offering a robust and flexible environment 
for the visualisation and analysis of economic indicators. With eurostatRTool, 
users can create customisable HTML dashboards that display a wide range of indicators 
through various visualisation types, including time series plots, bar charts, and maps. 
The package enables users to customise the overall layout, update underlying data, 
and select specific visualisation modes and interpretative texts to feature in the dashboard. 
This flexibility makes it easy to tailor the tool to specific needs, ensuring that the visualised data is both meaningful and accessible for viewers.

A standout feature of eurostatRTool is the storyboard layout from `Flexdashboard` that organises information into a sequence of slides. 
This layout allows to present a step-by-step narrative, providing readers with a more comprehensive understanding of the data. 
The user-friendly navigation enables viewers to move back and forth through the data story at their own pace, fostering a more interactive and engaging data exploration.
